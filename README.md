# Snake Classification Using Convolution Neural Net [CNN]

The requirements of the course's final project were to find a question, find data and answer that question using one of the models we've learned in the course. 

# Code
* EDA
* Image pre-processing
* CNN model creation and training
* Inference on 20 unseen snake images

# Data
Data was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilshingadiya/sample-0)

# Limitations
Data had garbage images that weren't of snakes.
Due to course time constraints we couldn't fully resolve and clean garbage images, hence the model is under-performing.
Added a presentation where you can find further information and explanations about the limitations of the model.
